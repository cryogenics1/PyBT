BLEThon
====

Yet a Hackable Bluetooth stack written in Python
------------------------------------------

BLEThon is a fork of a fork. First, it is a fork of a crappy half implementation of a Bluetooth stack in Python, then it's a fork of BLESuite's PyBT modifications.

BLEThon brings a new approach to make stuff work under Python 3.12+.

BLEThon emphasizes hackability over correctness. It mostly follows the
rules, unless you tell it not to.
